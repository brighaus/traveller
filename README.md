# traveller
Python CRUD system for making science fiction characters and careers based on the Games Designer's Workshop Traveller ruleset.

- Currently a work in progress.
- Includes some crude CLI scripts for working with characters and services.
- Includes a byte code file database with some premade characters.
- Most classes have self executing suites that demo its API.
